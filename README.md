# Java Processing Projects

Welcome to my collection of early Java projects built using the Processing framework. Created in 2016 when I was just 15, these projects represent my initial foray into interactive design and development, exploring fundamental game mechanics and graphical interfaces.
To run this project, It's recommended to use Processing 2

## Projects

### 1. Flappy Bird Clone

**File:** `FlappyBird1.pde`

A simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game. In this project, you control a bird as it navigates through obstacles while avoiding the top and bottom of the screen.

**Features:**

- Basic physics for gravitation.
- Dynamic obstacle generation for engaging gameplay.
- Scoring system to track and display player progress.

**Controls:**

- **click** to make the bird flap.

### 2. collection of my 3 main projects

**File:** `Lobby_2.pde`

This project showcases a graphical lobby. It serves as a menu for 3 of my latest projects in the 'nitzanei magshimim' program.

**Features:**

- Catch the parachute game
- Music player
- Paint clone
- user hub for my projects.

**Purpose:**

- I made 3 of my projects into 1 to highlight my skills back in the day. I presented it in front of a crowd at the end of the semester.
